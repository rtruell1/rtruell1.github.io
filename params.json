A\r\n    blank line before and after\r\n    the block is required.\r\n\r\nAll of the above are Markdown basics.  The following are all GFM or GitHub Flavored Markdown.\r\n\r\nAlthough the underscore is normally used for italics, it is ignored when there are multiple ones in a word, such as do_this_and_do_that_and_another_thing.\r\n\r\nIf all that's needed is a clickable URL without text, then just enter it, such as http://rtruell.ca/.\r\n\r\nSurrounding a word/phrase with two tildes (~) causes strikethrough text, as in the quick brown ~~cat~~ fox jumped over the lazy dog.  However, there is no Markdown way to underline words, so you have to use HTML, as in the quick brown <u>fox</u> jumped over the lazy dog.  Similarly, in order to do superscripts, you have to use E=MC<sup>2</sup> and for subscripts, H<sub>2</sub>O.\r\n\r\nIn GFM, you can use fences (3 tildes), instead of indenting 4 spaces, to create a code block, like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction test() {\r\n  console.log(\"notice the blank line before this function?\");\r\n}\r\n\r\nNote that a blank line before and after the fenced block isn't required, but\r\nmakes the raw Markdown easier to read.\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can do syntax highlighting in a code block by adding a language identifier, like this:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nrequire 'redcarpet'\r\nmarkdown = Redcarpet.new(\"Hello World!\")\r\nputs markdown.to_html\r\n```\r\n\r\nTables can be created using a dash to underline the first row and a pipe between columns.  Pipes at the start and end of each row can be used for aesthetic purposes, but aren't needed.  The number of dashes used to underline the first row don't have to match the length of the header text.\r\n\r\nWith pipes:\r\n\r\n| First Header  | Second Header |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- |\r\n| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |\r\n| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |\r\n\r\nWithout pipes:\r\n\r\n Third Header  | Fourth Header\r\n ------------- | -------------\r\n Content Cell  | Content Cell\r\n Content Cell  | Content Cell\r\n\r\nYou can also include inline Markdown such as links, bold, italics, or strikethrough:\r\n\r\n| Name | Description          |\r\n| ------------- | ----------- |\r\n| Help      | ~~Display the~~ help window.|\r\n| Close     | _Closes_ a **window**     |\r\n\r\nFinally, by including colons : within the header row, you can define text to be left-aligned, right-aligned, or center-aligned:\r\n\r\n| Left-Aligned  | Center Aligned  | Right Aligned |\r\n| :------------ |:---------------:| -----:|\r\n| col 3 is      | some wordy text | $1600 |\r\n| col 2 is      | centered        |   $12 |\r\n| zebra stripes | are neat        |    $1 |\r\n\r\n`test` `test` `test`\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
